      # Instead of a separate job, you can have steps to
      # deploy in the same job.
      # However, each would need to be made conditional on
      # env.RELEASED variable (set during npm run release)
      # being 1. For example:
      #
      # - name: Deploy Step 1
      #   id: deploystep1
      #   if: ${{ env.RELEASED == 1 }}
